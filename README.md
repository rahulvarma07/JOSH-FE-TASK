** Assignment ** 
This project is a front-end assignment in which I was tasked with replicating a Figma design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” without using any external libraries or frameworks. The goal was to closely match the layout, styling, and interactive elements from the given Figma file.

** Features Implemented ** 
Almost Pixel-perfect replication of the given Figma design
Fully functional interactive components using JavaScript
Layout and styles closely matching the original UI
Optimized for 100% zoom and 1440px screen width
Clean and organized codebase for HTML, CSS, and JS

** Avoided ** 
use of <table>, <tr>, <th>, or <td> for layout.
Avoided non-semantic tags like <hr> and <br> unless absolutely necessary.
Did not use frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or Material UI.

** What I Learned **
Practiced semantic and accessible HTML structure
Strengthened my CSS skills with custom layouts and styling
Improved JavaScript DOM manipulation without relying on libraries
